# Physics libraries

“A library implies an act of faith/Which generations still in darkness hid/Sign in their night in witness of the dawn.”
— Victor Hugo

Uses JBox2D code which is specific to Java.

The alternatives to try are matter.js or this sketch here:

But apparently we have this from noc:

This sketch solves the problem 5.2. SO lets start the chapter from there.

problem is converting this to box2d :
