### Nature of Code 
Nature of Code (noc) is abook by Daniel shiffman, where he investigates natural phenomena using code, written entirely in processing. Though an official conversion of all the code to javascript exists, I wanted to try my hand at translating the code to p5.js. 

This will include my attempts at additional modifications in the code also. So don't expect a code to code reference. Cheers!
