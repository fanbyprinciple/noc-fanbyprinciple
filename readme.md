### Nature of Code 
Nature of Code (noc) is a book by Daniel shiffman, where he investigates natural phenomena using code, written entirely in processing. I wanted to try my hand at translating the code in processing to p5.js, even though an official trancompilation exists. 

This will include my attempts at additional modifications in the code also. So don't expect a code to code reference. Cheers!
